Sherlock considers a string to be valid if all characters of the string appear the same number of times. It is also valid if he can remove just 1 character at index 1 in the string, and the remaining characters will occur the same number of times. Given a string s, determine if it is valid. If so, return YES, otherwise return NO.

Example:

1. s='abc'
This is a valid string because frequencies are {'a':1,'b':1,'c':1}.

2. s='abcc'
This is a valid string because we can remove one c and have 1 of each character in the remaining string.

3. s='abccc'
This string is not valid as we can only remove 1 occurrence of c. That leaves character frequencies of {'a':1,'b':1,'c':2}.
