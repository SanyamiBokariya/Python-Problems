An integer d is a divisor of an integer n if the remainder of n divide by d=0.

Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.

EXAMPLE-

1. n=124
   Check whether 1,2 and 4 are divisors of 124. All 3 numbers divide evenly into 124 so return 3.
   
2. n=111
   Check whether 1,1 and 1 are divisors of 111. All 3 numbers divide evenly into 111 so return 3.
   
3. n=10
   Check whether 1 and 0 are divisors of 10. 1 is, but 0 is not so return 1.
